## codeShow in the Windows 8 Store ##
Go to [aka.ms/codeshowapp](http://aka.ms/codeshowapp) to install codeShow from the Windows 8 Store

## Project Description ##
This is a Windows 8 HTML/JS project with the express goal of demonstrating simple development concepts for the Windows 8 platform. You may learn some stuff about end-to-end app architecture by looking at the source code of codeShow, but the primary goal of the project is to help you learn discrete programming tasks such as accessing the camera, implementing an asymmetric ListView, or handling errors look to codeShow.

### Clone or fork it? ###
Well, should I clone or fork it? The question is, are you going to contribute to the project (which you're encouraged to do by the way)? If not, then you only need to clone it. You'll still be able to easily get the latest changes. If you want to be a good citizen and make contributions to codeShow then you need to fork it. Forking a git project means that you are creating your own online repository that is linked to the original. This allows the project owner (us) to _pull_ in changes when you change something and submit a _pull request_.

### To clone it from Visual Studio 2013 ###
* open VS2013 and go to the Team Explorer tab (usually next to Solution Explorer)
* go to Settings | Git Settings
  * make sure your name and email are filled in (those are recorded in commits in git)
  * enter the path to your development folder
  * enable author images
* then drop the nav menu down and go to Project | Team Projects
* hit Clone and type in https://github.com/codefoster/codeshow
* verify you like the path where it's going to go
* hit Clone
* when it's done click on the project and then click on the .sln file to launch it
* now you can come back to the Commits section of Team Explorer and Sync anytime you want to get the latest changes

If you want to use other tools take a look at the [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) GitHubHelp page

**.then()**  
Regardless of which method you use to get the code down to your system, you'll want to do this afterward... open the codeshow\packages folder
install all of the SDKs included there
now open the .sln file in Visual Studio and have fun!
