		<p>codeShow JavaScript is a Universal App HTML/JS project with the express goal of demonstrating simple development concepts for the Windows platform. This is not a project to learn about end-to-end app architecture, but when you're looking for how to do things like access the camera, implement an asymmetric ListView, or handle errors look to codeShow.</p>
		<p>You can access the complete open source code for this app at <a href="https://github.com/codefoster/codeshow">https://github.com/codefoster/codeshow</a> and even collaborate with the project using Git.</p>
